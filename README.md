# üõí Marketplace Scraper Program

> **Disclaimer:** This program was developed **for educational purposes only**. It is not intended for commercial use or profit. The main goal is to demonstrate a technology to friends who are currently learning.
This project is a marketplace scraper built for educational purposes.
It demonstrates how to integrate a desktop GUI (using Tkinter) with a web version featuring a server and an admin panel. 
The goal is to provide insights into both desktop and web application development while experimenting with various technology elements.

The scraper in this project (implemented in files like scraper.py and scraper_cloudflare.py) is designed to:

- Fetch Marketplace Data: It sends HTTP requests to target marketplace websites to retrieve their data.
- Parse Content: Using libraries such as BeautifulSoup it parses the HTML response to extract relevant information like listings, prices, and other details.
- Handle Different Blocking Modes: The use of a separate scraper (scraper_cloudflare.py) indicates that one version is specifically tuned to bypass or handle Cloudflare's protections if the standard approach fails.
- Integration with Other Modules: The scraper is part of a larger system that includes a GUI, a server with an admin panel, and even a Telegram bot for sending notifications. This lets users view data in a desktop application, on a web dashboard, or receive alerts in real-time.

Overall, the scraper automates the process of collecting marketplace data, which can then be displayed or processed by other parts of the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Generate an Executable (Binary)

### using .env

do not forget to fill the .env it will crash if running `server.py`

remember to fill the .env if you don't want to have to write the same information everytime you open the app.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 1. Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

Use newer python (3.11)

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv_project
source ./venv_project/bin/activate
```
<!-- python3 -m venv ./venv_otavio -->

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 tkinter pyinstaller
pip install gunicorn
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Generate Executable

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

The executable will be located in the `dist/` folder (e.g., `dist/main` on macOS/Linux or `dist/main.exe` on Windows).

Alternatively, you can use a `.spec` file if already configured:

```bash
/Users/afa/Library/Python/3.9/bin/pyinstaller main.spec
pyinstaller --windowed  --onefile  main.py
## trying to build a non tech user app:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "MarketRoxoMonitor" --add-data ".env:." main.py
```

The above build should create a dist folder, there you can copy the .app folder to another machine and it should work provided that it has same compatibility.

Otherwise better luck building it in that machine from scratch

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings You Might Encounter

```bash
WARNING: The scripts macho_dump, macho_find and macho_standalone are installed in '/Users/afa/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or use --no-warn-script-location to suppress this warning.

WARNING: The scripts pyi-archive_viewer, pyi-bindepend, pyi-grab_version, pyi-makespec, pyi-set_version and pyinstaller are installed in '/Users/afa/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH.
```

To fix this, consider adding the following to your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/afa/Library/Python/3.9/bin"
```

`find . -type f -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n | awk '{print $2 ": " $1 " lines"}'`
total: 1478 lines

## SERVER VERSION

fill admin values
```bash
pip install flask python-dotenv requests beautifulsoup4 # missing
python3 server.py
# in prod:
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 server:app
```


## Format code!
```bash
    pip install autopep8
    autopep8 --in-place --recursive .
```

# Docker for local testing

```
    docker build -t my-python-app .
    docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/app my-python-app
    docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env my-python-app
    docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app my-python-app python server.py --reload
```
